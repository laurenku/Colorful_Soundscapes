# Colorful Soundscapes
App that uses the new Soli radar sensor in the Google Pixel 4 phone. Users use touch-free Soli interactions to generate unique soundscapes.

The purpose of Colorful Soundscapes is to enhance the user's environment. The app has storm, summer night, ocean, forest, library, party, and driving soundscapes that are interactive with reach and swipe (up, down, right, left) interactions. Sounds are associated with certain colors so the phone can be used as a colorful lamp.
