# Colorful_Soundscapes
App that uses the new Soli radar sensor in the Google Pixel 4 phone. Users use touch-free Soli interactions to generate unique soundscapes.

The purpose of Colorful Soundscapes is to enhance the user's environment. The app has storm, summer night, ocean, forest, library, party, and driving soundscapes that are interactive with reach and swipe (up, down, right, left) interactions. Sound begins when soli senses your presence. Sounds are associated with certain colors so the phone can be used as a colorful lamp. Reaching for the phone at least 3 times adds another layer of ambiance, and swiping up and down adjusts volume. Swiping right adds embellished sounds to the soundscape and swiping left generates a new soundscape and color.
